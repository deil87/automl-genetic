# automl-genetic [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/deil87/automl-genetic.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/deil87/automl-genetic)


AutoML is a pretty general term and could be thought of and implemented in many different ways with an exception of one thing being the same - they all should try to help us find best approaches(models) of solving a problem at hand.

Here we are trying to employ evolutionary algorithms and concepts to search the space of classifiers. In particularly we are interested in automatic construction of ensembles of classifiers because nowadays they have proved to be very efficient. 

This project has it's roots growing from following [paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10994-017-5682-0) and basically represents an attempt to implement, experiment and extend those ideas and provide convenient framework with simple API for researchers and businesses.

Contributions of any kind are very welcome! Please contact me deil_87@mail.ru for coordination of our efforts.
